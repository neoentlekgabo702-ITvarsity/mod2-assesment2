                           <p>WELCOME TO PINE CREST CENTRE
                              Pine Crest has served the community of Pinetown, KwaZulu-Natal, for nearly 30 years. It opened in the late 1980s to become the first shopping centre in the town, and it is still the biggest retail centre in Pinetown CBD. In 2017, Vukile acquired 100% of the centre and began planning its next chapter.

                            The renovation and rebrand of Pine Crest Centre has been completed and we’re ready to welcome you to a new premier shopping centre! We’ve added a brand-new urban Food Court with restaurants such as Spur, Nando’s, Roots Grill, KFC, Fishaways, Steers, Debonairs and Red’s Curry Pot. To complement the area, a kids’ play gym has been included for the little ones to enjoy.</p>
